## Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/git_summary/
├── cli.py              # Command-line interface
├── config.py           # Configuration management
├── github_client.py    # GitHub API client
├── fetchers.py         # API endpoint coordination
├── processors.py       # Event analysis and aggregation
└── models.py          # Data models and schemas
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Planning**: Technical requirements defined in PRDs
2. **Implementation**: Phased development following PRD milestones
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and performance tests
4. **Documentation**: Living documentation updated with each release

## Contributing

All major features and architectural changes should have corresponding documentation in this directory before implementation begins.
